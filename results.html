                <a href="https://asamsom.w3.uvm.edu/horizons/Group_Narrative.pdf">A short narrative as to the objectives of our portfolio!</a>
            </p>

            <h3>The description of how you decided on the weights to give each stock, given the following
                constraints: <br />
                Maximum Weight to any stock = 10% <br />
                Minimum Weight to any stock = 2%</h3>

                <h4>By Anja </h4>

            <p>After learning about different methods in class and evaluating the goal of our portfolio,
                we decided to use Python to optimize for a high Sharpe Ratio. Finding the highest Sharpe Ratio that 
                our portfolio can have ensures that we are balancing risk and return. We didn't want to optimize for 
                highest return because the goal of our portfolio is to be a safe fund for young adults starting their 
                retirement funds. Having a super risky portfolio was not something we were lookin for.
                We decided to not optimize for a low risk because our target demographic is young adults, so they
                have a while before retirement and can handle some risk.So, optimizing for a high Sharpe Ratio ended
                up being the best way forward for us.
